Course Project for ECE532

Connect 5 with an AI that runs in hardware on an Atlys board with a Xillinx FPGA. Vivado HLS will be used to help generated the hardware.

Board is represented in bitboard format. Each row is an integer, so board is int[BOARD_ROWS]. Can have at most 32 columns. Unused columns are wasted.
